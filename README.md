# CAD-files

This repo contains my most recent CAD projects as stl, which are representative of my skill in 3D modelling

## Seer.stl

I attended the Management and Technology Summer Institute at UPenn in 2022, which culminated in a team effort to pitch a new tech product. This stl file is the casing to house the electronic components (a Jetson Nano and a camera), while also making sure that it could attach to a car mirror, using a track and slide piece, which a spring was later added to. In addition, it features the logo of the company on the side.
